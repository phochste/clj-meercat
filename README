# clj-meercat

A SOLR-based library catalog discovery tool in Clojure

## Usage

This is still pre-alpha code. Work in progress..

## Installation

1. Install lein
2. Install solr
3. Run solr on port 8983
4. $ lein repl
   (use 'clj-meercat.core)
   (boot)
5. Connect browser to http://localhost:8080
6. Play a bit with resources/public/query.html
   I use Christophe Grand's <a href="http://github.com/cgrand/enlive">enlive</a>
   library to parse templates. Based on 'id' and 'class' attributes you can 
   tweak which information you want to display in the search results.
